Functionality

When using |recovery|, it is hard to tell, what has been changed between the
recovered file and the actual on disk version. The aim of this plugin is, to
have an easy way to see differences, between the recovered files and the files
restored on disk.

Therefore this plugin sets up an auto command, that will create a diff buffer
between the recovered file and the on-disk version of the same file. You can
easily see, what has been changed and save your recovered work back to the
file on disk.

By default this plugin is enabled. To disable it, use >
    :RecoverPluginDisable

To enable this plugin again, use >
    :RecoverPluginEnable
